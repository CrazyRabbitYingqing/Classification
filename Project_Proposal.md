## Project Proposal
### Question/Need:

Banks run into losses when a customer doesn't pay their loans on time. Because of this, every year, 
banks have losses in crores, and this also impacts the country's economic growth to a large extent. 
I want to help the banks to find out if a customer/person will be a loan defaulter or not.
With the prediction model I developed, the banks can raise up the loan bar (or other appropriate solution)
on the customer who has a better chance to become a loan defaulter to lower the risk of loosing money.

### Data Description:

I selected the data set from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/ankitkalauni/bank-loan-defaulter-prediction-hackathon

This dataset contains approximate 60,000 rows and 35 columns. The target is the "Loan Status" that the person
is Defaulter or not. Multiple features such as funded amount, location, loan, balance, etc. Some features are
numerical, some are categorical, so a feature engineering procedure is expected.

### Tools:

I will use python to further clean the dataset before analysis.
I will use python package (sklearn) to generate at least three classification models for the dataset.
I will use both python and Tableau for data visualization.

### MVP Goal:

In the MVP, I will use the cleaned up train data set to fit at least one classification model (Logistic-regression).
Metrics taught in the lessons will be applied and analysed. I will produce one to two plots to summarize my results.
